        <p>Dive into the mysterious theoretical tunnels that could connect distant parts of our universe.</p>
        <h3>Section 1: What Are Worm</h3>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.space.com/20881-wormholes.html" target="_blank"> Wormholes</a>,often called "Einstein-Rosen bridges," are hypothetical tunnels through spacetime that could connect distant locations instantly. First theorized by Einstein, they remain an intriguing possibility for space travel.</li>
                <li>Additional Point: Wormholes differ from black holes as theyâ€™re not endpoints, but rather potential shortcuts that link two locations.</li>

        <h3>Section 2: How Wormholes Might Work</h3>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>By bending space and time, wormholes could offer a faster-than-light shortcut across the cosmos. This section explains how they theoretically reshape spacetime.</li>
                <li>Additional Point: Wormholes could, in theory, connect not only locations in space but also different points in time, though this idea brings about complex scientific challenges.</li>

        <h3>Section 3: Types Of Wormholes</h3>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Traversable Wormholes: These theoretical tunnels could allow safe travel if they stay open long enough. However, they would need "exotic matter" to stabilize.</li>
                <li>Non-Traversable Wormholes: Much like black holes, these wormholes would collapse too quickly for anything to pass through.</li>
                <li>Additional Point: Some scientists believe that naturally occurring traversable wormholes could exist, but none have been observed to date</li>
