            Day trading futures involves buying and selling contracts for assets like commodities, stock indexes, or currencies within the same day to profit from price fluctuations. Unlike traditional stocks, futures contracts represent an agreement to buy or sell a specific asset at a set price in the future. However, day traders close their positions before the market closes, avoiding overnight risk.
            Key aspects of futures day trading include:</p>
           <ul> 
            <li>- Leverage: Futures allow traders to control large positions with relatively small amounts of capital, increasing potential profits (and losses).</li> 
            <li>- Liquidity: Popular markets, such as the NASDAQ or S&P 500 futures, offer high liquidity, making it easier to enter and exit trades.</li>
            <li>- Volatility: Futures markets often experience significant price swings, which day traders can capitalize on with well-timed entries and exits.</li>
            <li>- Risk Management: Effective strategies, including stop losses and position sizing, are crucial to limit losses due to high leverage.
            Successful day traders rely on a combination of technical analysis, discipline, and a well-defined strategy to profit from short-term price movements.</li>
        </ul>

<h3> Trading Basics / Terminology / Resources</h3>
<p>To begin trading, the first step is understanding how to access the market. The primary tool for this is a charting platform**, which gives you a comprehensive view of various assets across a wide range of markets, including indices, futures, forex, commodities, and more. This platform is essential for analyzing price movements, identifying trends, and making informed trading decisions across multiple asset classes.</p>
<h4>Preferred Platforms</h4>

</ul>
<p>All of these also act as a medium for broker access which will be covered shortly. Usage of a third part regular broker is fine aswell.

<h4>Brokers Explained</h4>
<p>Finding the correct broker is critical to starting in this industry. In a world full of hype on social media it is easy to get sucked into the overleveraged access some countries might have access to. Leverage is simply borrowed money. </p>
<h4>Examples / Brokers </h4>

    <p>Regulated brokers are associated with goverment entities that ensure the safety of your investments. Normally backed by the central bank in one way or another</p>
    <h4>Regulated Options</h4> 
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.ampfutures.com/" target="_blank">AMP</a> - Leverage Traditional is 1:10 which means $1 = $10 in buying power</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.schwab.com/td-ameritrade" target="_blank">TD</a> Ameritrade - Leverage is 1:50 which means $1 = $50 in buying power</li>
</ul>

<p>Unregulated brokers tend to have association with counteries that are very loose on monetary assets. Even though they tradition provide extremely high leverage this can be a catalyst to the failure of alot of new comers</p>
